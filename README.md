The following was a code challenge a buddy sent to me. This repo is my answer.

##### Background
You've been asked to build a pricing engine that prints out the estimated policy price for a given person. Keep in mind that this is an MVP that may fail once we launch, or could grow into a large application with very complex pricing rules. Try to strike a balance between creating an application that will be maintainable as it grows, with spending too much time building something that may end up failing. Please use whatever language youâ€™re comfortable with.  For best results, use a vanilla language, not a framework as this will force modeling, OO and will allow you to showcase your design decisions.

##### Challenge
The base cost of insurance is $100 annually.
For every 5 years over the age of 18 years old, the base price increases by $20. In this calculation, life insurance is only available for people over the age of 18.
Certain health conditions increase the cost of insurance:
+ Condition | Relative cost increase
+ Allergies | 1%
+ Sleep Apnea | 6%
+ Heart Disease | 17%
+ Females have a longer life expectancy, so receive a $12 discount on the final price.

##### Expected input
First Name | Age | Gender | Health Conditions
Kelly | 50 | female | Allergies
Josh | 40 | male | Sleep Apnea
Brad | 20 | male | Heart Disease
